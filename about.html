    <p> During the height of the pandemic in 2020, I decided to pick up a new hobby and start reading. I gathered a few friends and my school's librarian to try and organize a small book club. I had never been interested in reading before, and it took me a while to find the right books. Over the next year, I became a complete book nerd and learned about others and my background. Learning to love books not only made me a better reader but a better writer. I am involved in many writing competitions and proudly say I am confident in my writing. I want people of all ages to be able to pick up a book, whether it be a biology textbook or a fantasy book. I believe in the right to enjoy and value books of all kinds!

Below are my favorite books and authors! </p>
